# Technology-Test-2
Overview

This exercise demonstrates the testing framework that supports Behavior Driven Development for Automation Testing of web applications. 

As the task is open-ended, it leaves you with quite a few decisions to make.

The end result and the way to get there can be very simple or it can be very complex, depending on how you approach it.

Please note, the choice of application/service is not as important as the choice of automation itself.

All the best!
